# AI Video Summarization and Quiz Game

Welcome to the **AI Video Summarization and Quiz Game** project! This is a web-based application where users can upload a video, receive an AI-generated summary, and then play a quiz based on the content of the video. The goal is to make learning more interactive and fun by combining video summaries with a quiz game.
## Features

- **AI Video Summarization**: The app generates a brief summary of the uploaded video (currently simulated, can be replaced with an AI model for real use).
- **Quiz Game**: Users can answer multiple-choice questions based on the video summary to test their understanding.
- **Score Tracking**: Users get a score based on their answers to the quiz questions.
## Technologies Used
